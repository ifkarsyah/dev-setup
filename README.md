# dev-setup

## Introduction

Laptops come and go, whether it's a switch in companies with a shiny new laptop awaiting you or a personal decision to upgrade your trusted device. Despite these transitions, one thing remains constantâ€”your development stack. 

When setting up your new coding haven, the routine is familiar: install the essentials. Java, Python and C++, your tried-and-true programming language, then infra tools Terraform, Docker, and Minikube(for Kubernetes). These tools form the backbone of your development environment.

So, whether you're embarking on a new professional chapter or treating yourself to an upgraded personal laptop, this repo make sure your development foundation remains as stable as your favorite coding chair.
